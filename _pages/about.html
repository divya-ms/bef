<p class="author_subtitle" style="text-align: left" style="font-size:11px">I am an aficionado of the arts- this includes dance, painting, photography, food d√©cor, and basically any DIY project. The biggest struggle for me has always been balancing the part of me that is a complete science geek and the part of me that is passionate about art. One of my biggest regrets is how I completely neglected my artistic interests when I attended my STEM-focused high school. With the support of my friends and family, I'm glad that I finally found the courage to give photography a chance. I can't wait to meet new people and challenge myself to take unique and creative photos.</p>
