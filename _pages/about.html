<p class="author_subtitle" style="font-size:75%" style="text-align:left" >Hey there! I'm Divya, a DMV-based photographer who loves capturing perfect moments. I am an aficionado of the arts- this includes dance, painting, photography, food d√©cor, and basically any DIY project. My biggest struggle has always been balancing both the science geek and the passionate artist inside of me. Attending a STEM-focused high school, I completely neglected my artistic interests and I regret that. With the support of my friends and family, I'm glad that I finally found the courage to focus my efforts on photography. I can't wait to meet new people and challenge myself creatively!</p>
